            First she explored the innards of my desk, to the
            outtings of my apartment. Making sure every ledge, crevice,
            and corner was explored.

            <p>When I wasn't home, dima got into something she shouldn't 
                 have. I came home from work and found my dresser on top of her. 
                 She was mostly calm but couldn't move. It wasn't until I freed her 
                 that I noticed what had happened to her. Her arm was broken, so bad
                  amputation was an option if I didn't pay for surgery. I paid for the 
                surgery and made sure she got plenty of rest.

            <p>Dima is living a healthy fulfilling life now. The injury
                does not affect her running around and jumping, she meows
                As happily as any cat could. I currently don't live with Dima
                But she is in good hands with my sister. She gets plenty of
                treats and outside time!
